Compensatory resource allocation policies are sometimes used to mitigate this problem, but the evidence on the effects of such policies is limited. In this paper, we evaluate a large compensatory grant in Sweden, the Equity grant, which was launched by the government in 2017/2018 with the aim of improving the prospects of success for students with a disadvantaged background. The grant, which has since increased to more than SEK 7 billion per year, is allocated based on a socioeconomic index. We examine the relationship between education provider index and teacher-to-student ratio in the years before and after the introduction of the grant and find that teacher-to-student ratios are significantly more compensatory as the grant is introduced and then gradually expanded. Overall, however, we do not see that the increased teacher resources among providers serving disadvantaged students led to smaller test score differences between providers serving advantaged and disadvantaged students respectively. However, in grade 9, where the effect on class size is most pronounced, there are indications of improved student performance, which also translate into increased high-school enrollment.  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [IFAU WP 2025:15] \n    \n  \n\nAnnadanam, Harini, Jan Sauermann, and Aylin Shawkat, Board quotas, women’s representation in top management, and firm performance\n\n  \n    ▸ Show abstract\n    ▸ Download\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      This paper examines the  effects of a gender quota on supervisory boards implemented in Germany in 2016, which mandated 106 large firms to have at least 30% of women on their supervisory boards. Applying a difference-in-differences approach to panel data on firms, we find that the introduction of the quota increased the share of firms complying with the quota law. We also find, however, that this positive effect  originated from earlier attempts to introduce quotas for supervisory boards. We  neither find that other characteristics of supervisory board members are affected, nor that the quota created spillover effects on  the untargeted executive boards. For firm performance, we find, if any, positive effects of the quota introduction.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [Most recent version – please email me]\n    \n  \n\nLindquist, Matthew J., Jan Sauermann, and Yves Zenou, Peer Effects in the Workplace: A Network Approach\n\n  \n    ▸ Show abstract\n    ▸ Download\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      We study both endogenous and exogenous peer effects in worker productivity using an explicit network approach. We apply this method to data from an in-house call center of a multinational mobile network operator that include detailed information on individual performance. We find that an increase in average co-worker current productivity increases worker productivity, while an increase in average co-worker permanent productivity decreases worker productivity. We also investigate when peer effects matter and show that the relative importance of these two types of peer effects depends on the volume of incoming calls.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [Most recent version – please email me]\n      [Voxeu.org]\n      [Previously circulated as IZA DP No. 15131 and CEPR DP 10928]\n    \n  \n\nSauermann, Jan, and Anders Stenberg, Assessing Selection Bias in Non-experimental Estimates of the Returns to Workplace Training\n\n  \n    ▸ Show abstract\n    ▸ Download\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      We assess selection bias in estimated returns to workplace training by exploiting a field experiment in which workers were randomly assigned to a one-week training program. Using the causal estimate of the effect of the training program on worker productivity as a benchmark, we compare it to non-experimental estimates that is estimated using a sample who were chosen not to participate in the field experiment. Because the latter group is (potentially) endogenously selected, we expect the non-experimental estimates to be biased due to unobservable characteristics. The results show that non-experimental estimates are biased, yielding estimated returns of up to twice as high as the causal returns. We show that when controlling for  pre-treatment performance, individual fixed effects, as well as applying entropy matching, only a very small bias remains.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [Most recent version – please email me] [Previously released as IZA DP 13789]"

However, in grade 9, where the effect on class size is most pronounced, there are indications of improved student performance, which also translate into increased high-school enrollment.  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [IFAU WP 2025:15] \n    \n  \n\nAnnadanam, Harini, Jan Sauermann, and Aylin Shawkat, Board quotas, women’s representation in top management, and firm performance\n\n  \n    ▸ Show abstract\n    ▸ Download\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      This paper examines the  effects of a gender quota on supervisory boards implemented in Germany in 2016, which mandated 106 large firms to have at least 30% of women on their supervisory boards.

We also find, however, that this positive effect  originated from earlier attempts to introduce quotas for supervisory boards. We  neither find that other characteristics of supervisory board members are affected, nor that the quota created spillover effects on  the untargeted executive boards.

Because the latter group is (potentially) endogenously selected, we expect the non-experimental estimates to be biased due to unobservable characteristics.

Although workers' skills may directly matter for the cost of effort to reach performance goals, surprisingly little is known about the heterogeneity in the effects of incentive pay across workers. In this study, we apply a dynamic difference-in-differences estimator to the introduction of a generous bonus pay program to study how salient performance thresholds affect incentivized and non-incentivized performance outcomes for low- and high-skilled workers. While we do find that individual incentive pay did not affect workers' performance on average, we show that this result conceals an underlying heterogeneity in the response to individual performance pay: individual performance pay has a significant effect on the performance of high-skilled workers but not for low-skilled workers. The findings can be rationalized with the idea that the costs of effort differ by workers' skill level.

Researchers usually interpret this empirical pattern as evidence that the low skilled are vastly overconfident while the high skilled are more accurate in assessing their skill. However, measurement error alone can lead to a negative relationship between performance and overestimation, even if skill and overconfidence are unrelated. To clarify the role of measurement error, we restate the Dunning–Kruger effect in terms of skill and overconfidence. We show that we can correct for bias caused by measurement error with an instrumental variable approach that uses a second performance as instrument. We then estimate the Dunning–Kruger effect in the context of the exam grade predictions of economics students, using their grade point average as an instrument for their exam grade.

In the economic literature, the transfer of training is based on the theoretical framework of human capital theory and has been extensively analysed empirically in econometric studies that take account of unobserved heterogeneity of workers and the selectivity in training participation. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the underlying theoretical paradigm in economics, and the challenges faced in empirical research. The economic literature finds that participation in training is beneficial for both the participating workers and their employers, although there is also evidence that selectivity of workers matters. Despite this progress in the economic literature, the underlying processes through which training leads to a higher productivity remain unclear. We argue that this ‘black box’ offers opportunities for multi-disciplinary research projects on the transfer of training that relate the perspectives of educational and economic research.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [publisher version (gated)]\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      @article{DeGripSauermann2013,\ntitle = \"The effect of training on productivity: The transfer of on-the-job training from the perspective of economics\",\njournal = \"Educational Research Review\",\nvolume = \"8\",\npages = \"28 - 36\",\nyear = \"2013\",\nnote = \"Special Issue: Transfer of Training: New Conceptualizations Through Integrated Research Perspectives\",\nissn = \"1747-938X\",\ndoi = \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2012.05.005\",\nurl = \"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X12000437\",\nauthor = \"Andries De Grip and Jan Sauermann\",\nkeywords = \"Returns to training, Skills, Informal learning, Transfer of skills, Employee performance, Human capital\",\n}\n    \n  \n\nDe Grip, Andries, and Jan Sauermann (2012), The Effects of Training on Own and Co-Worker Productivity: Evidence from a Field Experiment, Economic Journal, 122(560), pp. 376–399\n\n\n  \n    ▸ Show abstract\n    ▸ Download\n    ▸ Show BibTeX\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      This paper analyses the effects of work-related training on worker productivity.

We find that participation in the training programme leads to a 10 percent increase in performance. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence for externalities from treated workers on their untreated teammates: An increase of 10 percentage points in the share of treated peers leads to a performance increase of 0.51 percent. We provide evidence that the estimated effects are causal and not the result of employee selection into and out of training. Furthermore, we find that the performance increase is not due to lower quality provided by the worker.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [publisher version (gated)]\n      [preprint]\n      Awarded the NRW Young Scientist Award 2012\n      SCOPUS Citations: \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      @Article{DeGripSauermann2012,\n  author={Andries De Grip and Jan Sauermann},\n  title={{The Effects of Training on Own and Co‐worker Productivity: Evidence from a Field Experiment}},\n  journal={Economic Journal},\n  year=2012,\n  volume={122},\n  number={560},\n  pages={376-399},\n  month={May},\n  keywords={},\n  doi={j.1468-0297.2012.02499.x},\n  url={https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v122y2012i560p376-399.html}\n}\n    \n  \n\nBorghans, Lex, Margo Romans, and Jan Sauermann (2010), What Makes a Good Conference?

The aim of this paper is to identify the preferences of participants with respect to conference characteristics. Based on a sample of European labour economists, preferences are measured using the vignette approach where participants are asked to choose between hypothetical European Association of Labour Economists (EALE) conferences. We find that the keynote speakers are the most important element in the preference for a conference, followed by the location of the conference. There is substantial heterogeneity in the taste of labour economists especially with respect to location, though the link between preference parameters and measured characteristics like gender, age and seniority is limited. Factor analysis suggests that the variety in preferences can be best described by a latent variable that reflects the weights people put on content versus fun.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [publisher version (gated)]\n      [preprint]\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      @Article{BorghansRomansSauermann2010,\n  author={Borghans, Lex and Romans, Margo and Sauermann, Jan},\n  title={{What makes a good conference?

We find that not only wage gains are driving the migration decision, but also differences in labour market opportunities, past migration experience and international student exchange are strong predictors of future migration. Contrary to our expectations, job characteristics such as the utilisation of skills in the job and involvement in innovation hardly affect the migration decision. When analysing country choice, countries such as the USA, Canada and Australia appear to attract migrants due to their larger R&D intensity. Moreover, graduates with higher grades are more likely to migrate to these countries.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [publisher version (gated)]\n      [preprint]\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      @Article{FouargeDeGripSauermann2010,\n  author={Andries de Grip and Didier Fouarge and Jan Sauermann},\n  title={{What affects international migration of European science and engineering graduates?}},\n  journal={Economics of Innovation and New Technology},\n  year=2010,\n  volume={19},\n  number={5},\n  pages={407-421},\n  month={},\n  keywords={migration; university graduates; scientists and engineers},\n  doi={10.1080/10438590903432871},\n  url={https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/ecinnt/v19y2010i5p407-421.html}\n}\n    \n  \n\nReinowski, Eva and Jan Sauermann (2008), Does Temporary Employment Affect the Work-related Training of Low-skilled Employees?, Journal for Labour Market Research, 41(4), pp. 489–499\n\n\n  \n    ▸ Show abstract\n    ▸ Download\n    ▸ Show BibTeX\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Similar to other European countries, the use of fixed-term contracts in Germany has been deregulated since the 1980s. Though temporary employment can be seen as a possibility to re-enter the labour market, it is argued that temporary employment may lead to 'dead-ends' and to lower investments in further training. From a theoretical perspective, there are arguments for higher and for lower investments in further training for employers and employees. Thus, it is not clear whether firms and employees invest differently when temporary contracts are used. Using the German Mikrozensus 2004, this paper analyses the effect of temporary contracts on work-related training for low-skilled workers. To take systematic differences between temporary and permanent employees into account, we estimate a bivariate probit model for whether fixed-term employment affects participation in work-related training. We conclude that holding a temporary contract does not have systematic disadvantages in access to further training. The use of temporary contracts does not therefore worsen the situation of low-skilled employees in terms of their human capital accumulation.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [publisher version (open access)]\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      @Article{ReinowskiSauermann2008,\n  author={Reinowski, Eva and Sauermann, Jan},\n  title={{Hat die Befristung von Arbeitsverträgen einen Einfluss auf die berufliche Weiterbildung geringqualifiziert beschäftigter Personen?

The public sector itself also uses measures to monitor and evaluate personnel, such as teachers.

Using data on individuals' application choices, we address endogeneity of program choice by exploiting admission cutoffs. These cutoffs, which are based on pupils' grade point averages (GPA), allow us to estimate the returns to educational contents in a regression discontinuity (RD) framework. In addition, we control for students' choice order to proxy for students' comparative advantages. We apply this RD design to estimate the effects of schooling contents on annual earnings from 1978-2014. For men, we find that vocational schooling has an earnings advantage over general schooling up and until the age of 27, with estimates thereafter close to zero. For women, we observe a similar earnings advantage for vocational schooling up and until the age of 23. For the longer term, there are no coherent earnings differences for men. For women with vocational schooling, there is a renewed earnings advantage from age 43 and onwards. We find suggestive evidence that this can be explained by further education completed in adulthood.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      [download]\n    \n  \n\nSauermann, Jan (2017), Training and Performance in Call Centers, CCP Research Brief 2, Center for Corporate Performance (CCP), May 2017\n\n  \n    ▸ Download\n  \n\nLindquist, Matthew J., Jan Sauermann, and Yves Zenou (2015), Why worker productivity is contagious, VoxEU Column\n\n  \n    ▸ Download\n  \n\nSauermann, Jan (2013), Human Capital, Incentives, and Performance Outcomes, Economisch Statistische Berichten (ESB) 98(4657).\n\n  \n    ▸ Download\n  \n\nSauermann, Jan (2013), Human Capital, Incentives, and Performance Outcomes, PhD Thesis, Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market (ROA) Dissertation Series 13, Maastricht.\n\n  \n    ▸ Download\n  \n\nCörvers, Frank, Arnaud Dupuy, and Jan Sauermann (2012), Kwalificatievereisten stijgen niet overal, Economisch Statistische Berichten (ESB) 97(4636).\n\n  \n    ▸ Download\n  \n\nKriechel, Ben, and Jan Sauermann (2012), Modeling replacement demand, in: Skills supply and demand in Europe – Methodological framework, European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), Research Paper 25, pp. 65-78.\n\n  \n    ▸ Download\n  \n\nDe Grip, Andries, and Jan Sauermann (2011), Het Effect van Ervaring op Productiviteit, Economisch Statistische Berichten (ESB) 96(4621).\n\n  \n    ▸ Download\n  \n\nDupuy, Arnaud, and Jan Sauermann (2011), Estimating Substitution Demand.\nDupuy, Arnaud, and Jan Sauermann (2011), Forecasting Skill Supply and Demand in Europe: Skill Upgrading in Europe, Technical Report, ROA Maastricht University.\nKriechel, Ben, and Jan Sauermann (2010), Forecasting Skill Supply and Demand in Europe to 2020: Replacement Demand – Methods and Results, Technical Report 005, Warwick: Institute for Employment Research.\nDupuy, Arnaud, and Jan Sauermann (2009), Measuring Skill-upgrading in the Dutch Labor Market, Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market, Maastricht University.\nDe Grip, Andries, Didier Fouarge, and Jan Sauermann (2009), De betekenis van internationale mobiliteit en allochtone bétatechnici voor de Nederandse arbeidsmarkt, PlatformPocket 9, 2009.

In order to control for the selection bias arising from different characteristics of individuals with fixed-term and permanent contracts, a bivariate probit model is applied.

You should approach your topic with the studies provided in the syllabus but should also conduct a careful literature search on your own. Critical reading of the relevant literature, summarizing and drawing your own conclusions from studies are an integral part of your work. It is important that you critically discuss the existing literature as well as theoretical concepts and empirical strategies.\nSoon after the kick-off meeting, you should get acquainted with the literature provided, explore more studies and then book a meeting to discuss the structure of your term paper.\nYour term paper should follow these formal requirements:\n\nTerm papers need to be written in English\nTerm papers may at most be 20 pages of text. This includes any tables and figure, but excludes table of contents, assurance, and references.\nFont: Times New Roman (or similar); Line spacing: 1,5; Font size: 12pt\nPlease use in-text citations (such as “as shown by Mayer (2008)” or “text here (Mayer, 2008).”) instead of citations in footnotes. Most of the assigned papers follow this style.\nPlease provide an assurance on the last page including your signatura. The text can be found on this page)"

The idea of the comment is to first give a (very) short summary and then to add own ideas, critical questions or additional input for example from your own topic. Comments should be critical yet polite. Optimally, the comments together with the term paper presentation can stimulate a discussion in which all students can participate."

I am associate professor (docent) at the [Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU)](https://www.ifau.se/en/) in Uppsala and am affiliated with the [Uppsala Center for Labor Studies (UCLS)](https://www.ucls.nek.uu.se) at Uppsala University, [ROA at Maastricht University](https://roa.nl), and [IZA Bonn](https://www.iza.org).

My research interests are centred around learning and incentives in the workplace, origins and consequences of course choice in education, and gender differences in the labour market. 

I edit the [NEP report on the economics of gender](https://econpapers.repec.org/scripts/nep.pf?list=nepger) ([subscribe here](https://nep.repec.org/nep-gen.html)),  organise the [Stockholm Uppsala Economics of Education Workshop Series](educworkshop.qmd), and occasionally write up useful commands on my [StataTeX Blog](https://statatexblog.com).
